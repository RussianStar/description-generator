# Project Outline

I want a small web based project that lets me select a folder. It should get all picture from the folder and subfolder and feed them to a local llm. The endpoint should be taken from the settings menu.

I want to have a collapseable textbox for the system prompt and also for the specific instruction prompt. Both should be included in the request to the llm. The output should be added to a list along with the picture. So the end is a scrollable list with picture and description. Make sure the picture and text has enough space. Both should have a small button to copy to clipboard. this way the user can just click and copy paste.

As for technology, use only basic web technology so it works on most modern browsers without additional installation.
